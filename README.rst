TicTacToe
=========

A small tic tac toe program designed to help me strengthen my C#.

Usage
-----

Download the git repo.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ git clone https://github.com/Damgaard/TicTacToe/
   $ cd TicTacToe

Then compile and run the project. Instructions will appear within the console
on how to play.

TODO
----

The program is feature complete. The areas that can be improved are those of
code style, naming and the algorithms utilized. All those areas will be
improved once I'm more experienced with the C# language and conventions.

Feature-wise. Additional AI's, views or testing could be added. As well as
better checking & parsing of the user inputs.
